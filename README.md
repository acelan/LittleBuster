# Little Buster

A WoW TBC Classic addon for converting ratings to value in tooltips. Currently distributed via [WowInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=26048#info), but releases are also published here on GitHub under Releases.

## Features
 
Supports tooltips with phrasing like:

 - +5 Block Rating
 - Equip: Increases your defense rating by 20.
 - Use: Increases your dodge rating by 300 for 10 sec.

Currently does not support:
 - The stat Resilience.
 - Ratings granted by gems or socket bonuses
 - Probably a handful of edge cases I haven't discovered
 - Locales other than enUS (though I'd happily accept a PR!)
